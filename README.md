# Super-Sales-Dashboard
## Introduction
The Superstore Sale Dashboard project aims to analyze and visualize online store sales data from the years 2012 to 2015. This README provides an overview of the project, including the problem statement, skills utilized, data sourcing, data transformation, modeling, analysis and visualizations, and concluding recommendations.

## Problem Statement
The primary objective of this project is to gain insights from the Superstore sales data and present them in an intuitive dashboard format. The analysis will focus on understanding various aspects of the sales, such as total revenue, total profits, top customers, top products, regional performance, and key performance indicators.

## Skills Utilized
Data Analysis

Data Transformation

Data Modeling

Data Visualization

SQL (for data modeling)

Python (for data analysis and visualization)
## Data Sourcing
The dataset used for this project is sourced from www.Kaggle.com . It comprises online store sales data from 2012 to 2015. The dataset includes information about orders, customers, products, and returns.

Data Source: Kaggle Superstore Dataset

## Data Transformation
The initial dataset will undergo various data transformation steps to make it suitable for analysis and modeling. These steps may include:

Cleaning and handling missing data
Combining relevant columns
Extracting necessary features
Formatting data types
## Data Modeling
The data will be modeled using three main tables: "orders," "people" (customers), and "returns." Relationships will be established between these tables to facilitate meaningful analysis. SQL will be used to create and manage the relational database.
